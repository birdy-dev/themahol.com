        Mahol (i.e. The Vibe) was founded by Sweta Maru and Amit Vaghela as they
        noticed there was no common platform for various artists and vendors
        across Canada for event opportunities. Mahol's mission is to bring your
        event dreams to life by crafting one-of-a-kind, custom, curated
        experiences. We also aim to create paid opportunities for artists and
        obtain recognition for the work they do. Our final goal, of course, is
        to spread happiness, which is derived from Mahol's definition.
